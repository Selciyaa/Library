      <h3>FICTION</h3>
      <p>
        A practical joker, knowing what he had done, waited until he was 
        asleep, then removed the gourd and tied it around his own leg. He, too, 
        lay down on the caravanserai floor to sleep. The fool woke first, and saw 
        the gourd. At first he thought that this other man must be him. Then he 
        attacked the other, shouting: ‘If you are me: then who, for heaven’s sake, 
        who and where am I?’
        This tale, which also appears in the Mulla Nasrudin 
        corpus of jokes which is known throughout Central 
        Asia,  is  preserved  in  the  great  spiritual  classic 
        Salaman  and  Absal, by the fifteenth-century author 
        and mystic Abdur-Rahman Jami. He came from 
        across the Oxus and died in Herat after establishing 
        himself as one of the greatest literary figures in the 
        Persian language.
        Jami caused a great deal of resentment among 
        divines  because  of  his  forthrightness,  especially 
        by saying that he recognised no teacher except his 
        own father.
